I have a dream to one day open up my own cafe one day, and that dream inspired me to create a website for coffee and tea lovers. I named it the Bobarista because when I was working at a boba tea shop, I came up with that name since I was technically a barista who worked with boba tea.

The main technologies used in this projected were React, Redux, and styled components. I gained a better understanding of how components worked and how props are passed, and it definitely gave me a better appreciation of these technologies.
